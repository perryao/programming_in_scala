# programming_in_scala
Examples from Programming In Scala, 3 ed.

The examples here are from chapters 34 and 35, which
discuss developing GUI applications using the swing framework.

Swing is mostly unsupported these days, so this is purely an
academic exercise. I'd avoid using the contents of this repo
for anything "real".
